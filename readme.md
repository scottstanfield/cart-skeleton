# Cartpole Sample 
A pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart,
which moves along a frictionless track. The system is controlled by
applying a force of +1 or -1 to the cart. The pendulum starts upright,
and the goal is to prevent it from falling over. A reward of +1 is
provided for every timestep that the pole remains upright. The episode
ends when the pole is more than 15 degrees from vertical, or the cart
moves more than 2.4 units from the center.

## WEB GUIDE 
If you're using the web interface, please follow the 
[quick start guide](http://docs.bons.ai/guides/getting-started.html).

## LOCAL (CLI) GUIDE

### CLI INSTALLATION
1. Install the Bonsai CLI by following our [detailed CLI installation
   guide](http://docs.bons.ai/guides/cli-guide.html).

### CREATE YOUR BRAIN
1. Setup your BRAIN's local project folder.  `bonsai create
   <your_brain>`
2. Run this command to install additional requirements for training your
   BRAIN.  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### HOW TO TRAIN YOUR BRAIN
1. Upload Inkling and simulation files to the Bonsai server with one
   command.  `bonsai push`

2. Run this command to start training mode for your BRAIN.  
	`bonsai train start`

3. Connect the simulator for training. Use the `--render` option to
   render the cartpole.  
   `python cartpole_simulator.py --brain=<your_brain> --render`

4. When training has hit a sufficient accuracy for prediction, about 250
   for at least 100 episodes, stop training your BRAIN.  `bonsai train
	stop`

### GET PREDICTIONS
1. Run the simulator using predictions from your BRAIN. You can now see
   AI playing the game!  `python cartpole_simulator.py
   --brain=<your_brain> --predict=<brain_version>`
